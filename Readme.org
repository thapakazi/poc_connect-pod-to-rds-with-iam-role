* Self Note
  
  #+begin_quote
  Frankly idc, if you can't understand any of these :P
  This resource is all rellated to EKS on AWS, IAM
  #+end_quote
  
  Nothing Facny; just dumping resources, I explored in last few weeks:

  - connect rds with pod iam role
  
  - Res:
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Connecting.Python.html

    - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-fine-grained-iam-roles-service-accounts

** Motivation
   - when attaching iam role to a pod 
     - we get these two env variables via admission controller mutating blah...
       #+begin_src yaml
env:
  - name: AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
    value: my-region-1 
  - name: AWS_REGION
    value: my-region-1 
  - name: AWS_ROLE_ARN
    value: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/sth_blah_web_identity_assume_role
  - name: AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE
    value: /var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/token
       #+end_src


   - Which we can use ~AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE~ and ~AWS_ROLE_ARN~ to connect to services like RDS :D
     -  eg: rds.py uses latest [[https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-minimum-sdk.html][botocore]] which understand those env variable to establish connection to rds

   - That is it :D
     - simple right, but it took me 10+hrs to make sense of it :see_no_evil:
